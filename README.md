Welcome to my Github!

Welcome to my Github profile! I'm excited to have you here and show you what I've been working on. As a former healthcare professional, software developer, I'm passionate about building high-quality applications and bringing creative solutions to complex challenges. My Github is a place where you can find my latest projects, contributions to open source, and collaborations with other developers. I believe that Github is not only a platform for sharing code, but also a community of likeminded individuals who are committed to making the world a better place through technology. So please take a look around and feel free to connect with me!
